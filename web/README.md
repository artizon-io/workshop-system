### Fixing Bad Design Decisions

Don't waste time fixing the design decision mistakes that you have made in the past. You will always make bad design decisions. The solution is to always keep the code that you write encapsulated into its own little dark box and just leave it alone. And, don't make your future code relies on your current opinionated design of yours.
